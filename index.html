            Ever been lost but had nowhere to turn to? Yeah, us too. Believe that.
            That's why we coded up this application. Find where you're itching to go
            and get it scratched already. We help you get scratched. Time square is just
            around the corner. We found it for you! No more hard stuff required; just sit
            back and watch the data simmer. Let <i>us</i> do the cooking for a change and quit crying!
            You're the customer, after all.
